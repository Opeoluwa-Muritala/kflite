I would say kflite is a fresh and improved version of  [moko tensorflow](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-tensorflow)

## Getting Started
### Adding dependencies
Add it in your `commonMain.dependencies` :

  ```
  implementation("io.github.shadmanadman:kflite:0.60.0")
  ```

In active development
